IPFS-Lite is an embeddable, lightweight IPFS peer. This fork started
from [ipfs-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite).

It offers all the features of main [ipfs-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite). For certain requirements of
datahop it adds some more features of full ipfs, such as config, repo, leveldb etc.

## Examples

### cli client
```
 go run ./examples/litepeer/litepeer.go
```

### mobile client
```
  go run ./examples/mobilepeer/mobilepeer.go
```

## Objectives

* [x] create cache repo as ipfs

* [x] generate gomobile binding for android
* [x] adding content
* [x] replicating content
